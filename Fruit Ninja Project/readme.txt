Project Description:

At its core, my term project will resemble the famous mobile game, Fruit Ninja. In short, my game will take advantage of the user's mouse movement to slice fruit that appear to “fly” onto the screen from the bottom of the board. By commanding the mouse through a fruit, the fruit will slice into two and fall. Points will be awarded to the user based on the kind of fruit cut and the amount of fruit cut in one slice. Fruit that appear on the screen and fall off the screen unscathed will result in a strike. Three strikes will result in an immediate loss. As the score of the user increases, the game will get progressively harder. This will be done by reducing the time interval between when fruits are launched on screen, increasing the amount of fruit launched at a time, and increasing the frequency with which bombs appear on the screen as well. The fruits will obey basic rules of gravity, traversing the screen as one would expect in real life if a fruit was thrown into the air. Each fruit will have a random initial velocity in the X and Y directions. These rules apply when the fruit has been sliced into two as well. Additionally, bombs will also appear on the screen. The same physics principles apply to bombs. Slicing a bomb will result in the immediate loss of the user. 
	
In an attempt to make the game as close to the original as possible, I hope to create a similar UI, utilizing the slicing of fruit to toggle between modes. I also hope to create customizable blades that alter the display of the cut. I want to create a leaderboard that utilizes a CSV file to display the highest scores in each game mode. Lastly, I want to create a Multiplayer game mode that allows multiple individuals to play and compete simultaneously. In the multiplayer mode, there will be a set time limit. Within that time limit, competitors will fight to see who can slice as many fruit as possible. The multiplayer mode will allow competitors to sabotage their opponents by sending items that will hinder gameplay. The player with the highest score at the end will be deemed the winner. 

Run Instructions:

To run this app, please run the "Fruit Ninja.py" file in the text editor of your choice. To ensure that the leaderboard system works, be sure to place the csv files titled, "scores.csv" and "scoresMultiplayer.csv" next to the "Fruit Ninja.py" file. Aside from CMU Graphics, no additional module must be installed to run this code. CMU Graphics can be installed easily by downloading "cmu_graphics" from their website, creating a new Python file in your text editor with the proper import statements, and unzipping the file downloaded from CMU and placing it next to the Python file you have created. Aside from that, my code simply takes advantage of Python's in-built modules like csv, random, and math. 

Shortcut Commands:
When in "Classic" mode, pressing the key "s" will instantly end the game and send you to the "Game Over!" screen. When in "Multiplayer" mode, pressing the key "s" will reduce the timer by 10.
